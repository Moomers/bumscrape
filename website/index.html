        <h3>What is BumScrape</h3>
        <p>
        BumScrape is a web-crawling scraper which collects data about Burning Man tickets scalped on the Internet.
        BumScrape periodically visits popular ticket-vending websites; we currently check Craigslist, eBay and StubHub.
        Whenever we find a BM ticket listing on one of these sites, we log information about the listing in a database.
        We will keep track of how the listing progresses for as long as the listing is visible on the site where we found it.
        The goal is to get an idea of the size and properties of the external resale market in BM tickets.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens to the data you gather?</h3>
        <p>
        We are happy to let you see our data!
        Check out all of the active listings we're currently tracking <a href="/listings">here</a>.
        You can get a copy of our archived data <a href="/listings?list_all=1&format=json">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Please don't use this site to buy a scalped ticket!
        Paying over face-value for a ticket encourages more scalping and commoditizes our community.
        </p>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
        We used the <a href="http://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a> web-scraping framework for <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>.
        We wrote <a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.14/topics/spiders.html">spiders</a> for each of the sites we're interested in.
        Those spiders generate <a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.14/topics/items.html">items</a> which we validate and then save into a <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> database via an <a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.14/topics/item-pipeline.html">item pipeline</a>.
        So far, only our Craigslist crawler is a traditional web scraper -- we also use the APIs provided by StubHub and eBay, but we wrap those API calls in spider semantics.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I help?</h3>
        <p>
        We could probably use more spiders.
        If you know of a ticket-vending site we're not aware of, write a spider for it and send us a patch.
        </p>

        <h3>I want to gather the data myself! How do I use your software?</h3>
        <p>
        Our code is available via git; simply do a <code>git clone http://igor.moomers.org/git/bumscrape</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        To crawl, you'll need to install python and scrapy.
        If you want to save the data, you'll need a MySQL db and the <a href="http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html">mysqldb module</a>.
        If you want to use a different DB, you can replace the <code>Store</code> class in <code>store.py</code>.
        To use the eBay API, you'll need to <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/ebay">get an eBay developer account</a>.
        It's free, but you're limited to 5k queries per day unless you work with them to get your app certified.
        </p>

        <p>
        This website uses <a href="http://webpy.org">web.py</a>, a lightweight python web framework.
        We are running on Apache 2 and using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">modwsgi</a>.
        If you want to run a similar site, you can use <a href="apache.config">our apache config</a> as a starting point.
        </p>

        <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>

        <p>
        Many of us at <a href="http://igor.moomers.org/bm">Camp Warp Zone</a> didn't win tickets in the 2012 ticket lottery.
        Like many burners, we were curious why so few tickets ended up in the hands of the people we knew in the community.
        We thought of three possible outcomes:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Many burners bought too many tickets to increase their odds, and were embarrased to come forward</li>
            <li>Lots of burgins not affiliated with any theme camps bought all the tickets</li>
            <li>Scalpers beat the BMOrg and were sitting on a ticket bonanza</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        We don't have enough data to speak about the first two possibilities.
        Possibly, the BMOrg does, but they're very unlikely to release the data given their MO.
        BumScrape is an attempt to explore the third possibility.
        Scalpers cannot sell tickets in secret -- they do it out in the open, on the internet.
        Lets keep tabs on them!
        </p>

        <h3>Who are you people?</h3>

        This project was created by <a href="https://plus.google.com/106232453080473820116">Jered Wierzbicki</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/111898530544158794681/posts">Igor Serebryany</a>
        We are just a couple of burners hoping to make the world a better place ... for burners.
        Our other awesome playa projects included a pixel-for-pixel replica of the Mario castle from the original SMB (4:30 &amp; E, 2010) and <a href="http://www.moomers.org/~jered/pipe-dream/">Pipe Dream</a>, a 20'-tall climbing structure (4:00 &amp; A, 2011).
        Assuming we get tickets, come find us on the playa at Camp Warp Zone!
