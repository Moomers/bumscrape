<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Scalpers could wreck burning man, we should keep an eye on this.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>

<h2>So what is this?</h2>

<p>BumScrape is a program that collects data about Burning Man tickets being
resold on the web. BumScrape periodically visits popular ticket-vending
websites; we currently check
<a href="http://craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>,
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> and
<a href="http://www.stubhub.com/">StubHub</a>. Whenever we find
a BM ticket listing on one of these sites, we log information about the
listing in a database. We track each listing for as long as it's posted.
The goal is to get an idea of the size and properties of the external resale
market in BM tickets.</p>

<h2>What happens to the data you gather?</h2>

<p>All our data is public. Check out all of the active listings we're
currently tracking <a href="/">here</a>. You can get a copy of our archived
data <a href="/?list_all=1&format=json">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please don't use this site to buy a scalped ticket! Paying over
face-value for a ticket encourages more scalping and commoditizes our
community.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>We used the <a href="http://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a> web-scraping
framework for <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>. We wrote
<a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.14/topics/spiders.html">spiders</a> for
each of the sites we're interested in. Those spiders generate
<a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.14/topics/items.html">items</a> which we
validate and then save into a <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> database
via an <a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.14/topics/item-pipeline.html">item pipeline</a>.
So far, only our Craigslist crawler is a traditional web scraper&mdash;we also
use the APIs provided by StubHub and eBay, but we wrap those API calls in
spider semantics.</p>

<h2>How can I help?</h2>

<p>We could use coding help to create more spiders. If you know of a
ticket-vending site we're not aware of, let us know, or write a spider for
it and send us a patch.</p>

<h2>I want to gather the data myself! How do I use your software?</h2>

<p>The code is available via git:</p>
<code class=box>git clone http://igor.moomers.org/git/bumscrape</code>

<p>To crawl, you'll need to install Python and scrapy. If you want to save
the data, you'll need a MySQL db and the
<a href="http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html">mysqldb module</a>.
If you want to use a different database, you can replace the <code>Store</code>
class in <code>store.py</code>. To use the eBay API, you'll need to
<a href="https://www.x.com/developers/ebay">get an eBay developer account</a>.
It's free, but you're limited to 5k queries per day unless you work with
them to get your app certified.</p>

<p>This website uses <a href="http://webpy.org">web.py</a>, a lightweight
python web framework. We are running on Apache 2 and using
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">modwsgi</a>.
If you want to run a similar site, you can use
<a href="apache.config">our apache config</a> as a starting point.</p>

<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>

<p>Many of us at <a href="http://igor.moomers.org/bm">Camp Warp Zone</a>
didn't win tickets in the 2012 ticket lottery. Like many burners, we were
curious why so few tickets ended up in the hands of the people we knew in
the community. We thought of three possible scenarios:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Many burners bought too many tickets to increase their odds, and
    were embarrased to come forward.</li>
    <li>Lots of burgins not affiliated with any theme camps bought all the
    tickets.</li>
    <li>Scalpers beat the BMOrg and are sitting on a ticket bonanza.</li>
</ol>

<p>Probably the truth is somewhere in between. We aren't sure about the
first two scenarios, but we're especially worried about the third. BumScrape
is an attempt to see how widespread scalping is. Scalpers cannot sell
tickets in secret&mdash;they do it out in the open, on the web. Let's keep
tabs on them!</p>

<h2>Who are you people?</h2>

<p>This project was created by
<a href="https://plus.google.com/106232453080473820116">Jered Wierzbicki</a> and
<a href="https://plus.google.com/111898530544158794681/posts">Igor Serebryany</a>.
We are just a couple of burners hoping to make the world a better place...
for burners. Our awesome playa projects included a pixel-for-pixel
replica of the Mario castle from the original SMB (4:30 &amp; E, 2010)
and <a href="http://www.moomers.org/~jered/pipe-dream/">Pipe Dream</a>,
a 20'-tall climbing structure (4:00 &amp; A, 2011). Assuming we get
tickets, come find us on the playa at Camp Warp Zone!</p>
